opus is much better at SPICE syntax
chatgpt5 makes very sophisticated testbenches but fails hard at syntax
well known circuits are created well even if they are complicated, examples include current mirror and OTA and dual input stage comparator
less known circuits do not work, even if the are simple, best example is source follower
Opus is really bad in biasing circuits in general, but the circuit to be biased, for example the differential pair, works if correct biasing is applied
one could
