Awesome—let’s build a classic long-tailed NMOS differential pair with a PMOS current-mirror load (single-ended output). The deck below is **fully runnable in NGSPICE** against your uploaded GF180 3.3 V typical models (nmos\_3p3 / pmos\_3p3). Models are from your file (included via `.include`) .

# Design approach & topology

* **Core:** NMOS input pair (M1/M2), single NMOS tail source (MTAIL), PMOS mirror load (M3 diode-connected, M4 mirror). Single-ended output is the **drain of M2** (`out`).
* **Biasing:** A simple **NMOS diode + resistor** generates a \~100 µA reference (MREF + RB), mirrored to MTAIL (1:1) → **Itail ≈ 100 µA**. A small bypass cap on the bias node suppresses AC feed-through.
* **Why this choice:** The PMOS mirror converts differential current into a single-ended voltage with higher gain than resistor loads, while using minimal headroom—ideal at **VDD=3.3 V** and **VCM=1.65 V**.

---

# First-order sizing & targets

We budget the 100 µA tail to split ≈50 µA/branch at VCM.

* Target **NMOS overdrive** $V_{\text{ov,n}}$ ≈ 0.25 V →
  $g_{m,n} \approx \dfrac{2I_D}{V_{\text{ov}}} = \dfrac{2\cdot 50\,\mu A}{0.25\,V} \approx 0.4\,\text{mS}$.
* Use slightly **longer L** to improve $r_o$ and meet $R_{\text{out}}$ spec: choose **L=0.6 µm** for M1–M4 and **L=1.2 µm** for MTAIL/MREF. Widths chosen to keep $V_{\text{ov}}$ small and headroom healthy:

  * M1/M2: **W=12 µm, L=0.6 µm**
  * M3/M4: **W=24 µm, L=0.6 µm** (p-devices wider to compensate µp < µn)
  * MTAIL/MREF: **W=24 µm, L=1.2 µm**
* Rough gain estimate with current-mirror load:
  Single-ended $A_d \approx g_{m,n}\left(r_{o,n}\parallel r_{o,p}\right)$.
  Designing for $(r_{o,n}\parallel r_{o,p}) \approx 50\,\text{k}\Omega$ and $g_{m,n}\approx0.4\,\text{mS}$ →
  $A_d \approx 0.0004 \times 50\,000 \approx 20\,\text{V/V} \approx 26\,\text{dB}$ (meets **≥25 dB**).
* **Output resistance spec**: pick L longish to get each $r_o \gtrsim 100\,\text{k}\Omega$ so the parallel combination stays **≥50 kΩ**; at **1 kHz** the **2 pF** load is \~80 MΩ, so it does not degrade $R_{\text{out}}$.

Headroom check @ VCM=1.65 V (typical $V_{th,n}\sim 0.7\,\text{V}$, $V_{\text{ov,n}}\sim 0.25\,\text{V}$ → $V_{GS,n}\sim0.95\,\text{V}$): input-pair source node sits ≈0.7 V, giving MTAIL **VDS ≈ 0.7 V** (safely saturated). PMOS mirror has plenty of VSD margin near mid-supply output.

# Equations used

* Transconductance (long-channel approx):
  $g_m \approx \dfrac{2I_D}{V_{\text{ov}}}$.
* Output resistance (first order):
  $r_o \approx \dfrac{1}{\lambda I_D}$ (improves with longer L).
* Single-ended diff gain with mirror load (approx.):
  $A_d \approx g_{m,n}\left(r_{o,n}\parallel r_{o,p}\right)$.
* Output impedance at 1 kHz:
  $R_{\text{out}}(1\,\text{kHz}) \approx (r_{o,n}\parallel r_{o,p})\ \big\|\ \frac{1}{j\omega C_L}$
  and $\left|\frac{1}{j\omega C_L}\right| \approx \dfrac{1}{2\pi\cdot1\,\text{k}\cdot2\,\text{pF}}\approx 79.6\,\text{M}\Omega\Rightarrow$ negligible.

# Testbench approach

* **DC/OP**: verifies bias currents and node voltages with **±5 %** VDD tolerance (your deck uses VDD=3.3 V; you can `.step param VDD 3.135 3.465 0.165` if you like).
* **AC (gain)**: drive inputs differentially: `Vin_p` AC=+0.5 mV, `Vin_n` AC=−0.5 mV so $V_{diff}=1\,\text{mV}$. We measure **V(out)** and **V(in\_p, in\_n)** at **1 kHz** and compute **Ad(dB)** as their dB difference.
* **Rout**: use **.tf** with a 0 V test source `Vx` from out→0 to obtain the small-signal input resistance seen at the output node. With $C_L=2\,\text{pF}$ its effect at 1 kHz is negligible, so the DC small-signal **Rin** from `.tf` equals **Rout\@1 kHz** to excellent approximation.

# What to expect (and how to tweak if needed)

* **Gain @1 kHz:** With the given sizes, first-order math yields **\~26 dB** (≥25 dB). If you see <25 dB, increase **M1/M2 W** (raise gm) and/or **L of M1–M4** (raise ro).
* **Rout:** `.tf` will print the **input resistance** at `VX`; that is the **output resistance** seen at `out`. It should be **≥50 kΩ**. If short, increase **L** of both PMOS and NMOS output devices (M2, M4) and/or reduce their $V_{\text{ov}}$ (increase W).
* **Compliance & VDD ±5 %:** There’s ample headroom: `ntail` ≈ 0.7 V, `out` near mid-supply. If saturation is marginal at **VDD=3.135 V**, lower $V_{\text{ov}}$ by increasing W of M1–M4 and MTAIL slightly (keeps same current but buys headroom).
* **Noise / matching (layout notes):** Use common-centroid for M1/M2, interdigitate fingers, match L and guard rings. Keep M3/M4 symmetrical with shared well tie to VDD.

# Verification checklist

* **DC:** `.op` — confirm **I(RB) ≈ 100 µA**, **I(MTAIL) ≈ 100 µA**, and **\~50 µA** in each branch at VCM=1.65 V.
* **AC Gain:** the `.meas` lines report **AD\_DB** and **AD\_VV** at **1 kHz** (success if **≥25 dB** / **≥17.8 V/V**).
* **Rout:** `.tf` reports the **input resistance at VX** (success if **≥50 kΩ**).
* **Load:** included `CLOAD=2 pF`. At 1 kHz it barely affects gain or Rout; at higher f, it sets the dominant pole with $R_{\text{out}}$.

If you want, I can provide a stepped deck to sweep **VDD ±5 %**, **W/L**, or **CL** and auto-report margins.
