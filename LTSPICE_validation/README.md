# LTSpice Validation Circuits

These folders contain hand-created working implementations of the LLM-designed circuits for validation purposes.

- **Opus_circuits/**: Working LTSpice implementations of Claude Opus 4.1 designs
- **Chatgpt_circuits/**: Working LTSpice implementations of ChatGPT-5 designs

These were created to validate circuit functionality when LLM syntax failures prevented direct simulation.
