# Single Transistor Switch Design

## Design Approach and Topology Choice

I'll design an NMOS transistor switch, which is the simplest and most common topology for this application. The NMOS transistor will act as a voltage-controlled resistor:
- When VGS = 0V (OFF state): High resistance, effectively open circuit
- When VGS = 3.3V (ON state): Low resistance Ron, allowing current flow

The topology consists of:
- NMOS transistor with gate as control input
- Source connected to ground
- Drain connected to load
- Body/substrate connected to ground

## Design Equations and Calculations

### Key Parameters from GF180nm Model
From the nmos_3p3 model:
- VTH0 = 0.7V (threshold voltage)
- u0 = 0.024 m²/Vs (mobility)
- toxe = 8e-9 m (oxide thickness)

### On-Resistance Calculation

For an NMOS operating in the triode/linear region (as a switch), the on-resistance is:

**Ron = 1 / [μn·Cox·(W/L)·(VGS - VTH)]**

Where:
- Cox = εox/tox = (3.9 × 8.854×10⁻¹²) / 8×10⁻⁹ = 4.32×10⁻³ F/m²
- VGS - VTH = 3.3V - 0.7V = 2.6V (overdrive voltage)

Rearranging for W/L ratio with Ron ≤ 500Ω:

**W/L ≥ 1 / [μn·Cox·(VGS - VTH)·Ron]**
**W/L ≥ 1 / [0.024 × 4.32×10⁻³ × 2.6 × 500]**
**W/L ≥ 7.4**

### Transistor Sizing

Choosing L = 0.18μm (minimum allowed):
- Required W ≥ 7.4 × 0.18μm = 1.33μm
- **Selected: W = 2.2μm, L = 0.18μm** (W/L = 12.2)
- This provides ~65% margin for process variations

### Verification Calculations

Expected Ron with chosen sizing:
- Ron = 1 / [0.024 × 4.32×10⁻³ × 2.6 × 12.2]
- Ron ≈ 304Ω (< 500Ω ✓)

## Testbench Approach

The testbench will:
1. Apply VGS = 3.3V to turn the switch ON
2. Force 1mA through the switch using a current source
3. Measure VDS to calculate Ron = VDS/ID
4. Perform DC sweep to characterize Ron vs. ID
5. Verify transistor remains in triode region

## Verification of Operating Conditions

The design meets all specifications:
1. **Ron < 500Ω**: Calculated Ron ≈ 304Ω with safety margin
2. **Triode Operation**: With VDS ≈ 0.3V < VDS,sat = 2.6V, transistor operates in triode
3. **Minimum Dimensions**: W = 2.2μm > 0.22μm, L = 0.18μm ≥ 0.18μm
4. **Current Handling**: Can handle 1mA with low voltage drop
5. **Logic Levels**: Compatible with 0V/3.3V logic levels

The netlist includes comprehensive analysis to verify the design meets all requirements and operates correctly as a low-resistance switch.
