1,Single Transistor Switch,Opus,equations,correct/partially correct/incorrect,correct/partially correct/incorrect,correct/partially correct/incorrect,incomplete,"- calculations gave Ron of 304?, however simulation gave Ron of 1.5k?
- this was not adressed in the testbench, only commented that Ron is > 500?"
