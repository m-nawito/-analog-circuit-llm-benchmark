7,Cascode Current Mirror,ChatGpt5,equations,partially correct,simulations,partially correct,complete,partially fullfilled,"* wrong and strange biasing by applying a fixed voltage at the gate of M3 which is connected through the drain to IREF. This resulted in  the reference drain current of 20uA  flowing through the body. VD of M3 was 149V
