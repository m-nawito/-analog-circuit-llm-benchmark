Given these SPICE models GF180nm_sm141064_simplified.txt, design a Basic Current Mirror with the following specifications:

- Supply voltage: VDD = 3.3V
- Reference current: Iref = 50μA
- Current ratio: Iout/Iref = 2:1
- Output current accuracy: ±10%
- Minimum output voltage: Vout_min = 0.3V (saturation)
- Load resistance: Variable (for testing)
- Temperature: 27°C
- Process corner: Typical
- Process: GF 180nm CMOS
- Supply voltage tolerance: ±5%
- Simulation: DC analysis minimum
- All transistor widths ≥ 0.22μm
- All transistor lengths ≥ 0.18μm
- SPICE simulator: NGSPICE
- Success Criteria: Iout = 100μA ± 10% when Iref = 50μA

Explain your design decisions and calculations in detail, including:
- Design approach and topology choice
- All equations used
- Component value calculations
- Testbench approach and analysis choice
- Verification of operating conditions

Provide the complete NGSPICE netlist. Ensure that the output netlist is completely runnable and compatible with NGSPICE.
