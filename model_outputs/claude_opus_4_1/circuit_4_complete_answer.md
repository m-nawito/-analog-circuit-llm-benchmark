Looking at this current mirror design task, I need to create a basic NMOS current mirror with a 2:1 current ratio, where Iref = 50μA and Iout = 100μA.

## Design Approach and Topology Choice

I'll use a basic NMOS current mirror topology because:
- Simple and robust design with good matching characteristics
- Accurate current ratios achievable through W/L scaling
- NMOS devices provide good performance at these current levels
- Suitable for the specified output voltage range (Vout_min = 0.3V)

The topology consists of:
1. Reference branch: Resistor R1 from VDD to set Iref
2. M1: Diode-connected NMOS (reference transistor)
3. M2: Output NMOS with 2× the W/L ratio of M1

## Design Calculations

### 1. Reference Current Setting

From the NMOS model parameters:
- VTH0 = 0.7V
- For ID = 50μA, I estimate VGS ≈ 0.9-1.0V

Reference resistor calculation:
- VR = VDD - VGS_M1 ≈ 3.3V - 0.95V = 2.35V
- R1 = VR / Iref = 2.35V / 50μA = 47kΩ

### 2. Transistor Sizing

Using the square-law equation in saturation:
ID = (μnCox/2) × (W/L) × (VGS - VTH)²

From the model:
- μnCox ≈ u0 × Cox ≈ 0.024 × (3.9×ε0/toxe) ≈ 103μA/V²

For M1 at ID = 50μA:
- Assuming VGS - VTH ≈ 0.25V (moderate inversion)
- (W/L)₁ = 2×ID / [μnCox×(VGS-VTH)²]
- (W/L)₁ = 2×50μA / [103μA/V²×(0.25V)²] ≈ 15.5

Choosing practical dimensions:
- **M1**: W = 4μm, L = 0.25μm → W/L = 16
- **M2**: W = 8μm, L = 0.25μm → W/L = 32 (for 2:1 ratio)

### 3. Current Mirror Ratio

Iout/Iref = (W/L)₂ / (W/L)₁ = 32/16 = 2 ✓

### 4. Operating Condition Verification

**M1 Saturation**: VDS₁ = VGS₁ ≈ 0.95V > VGS₁ - VTH = 0.25V ✓

**M2 Saturation**: At Vout_min = 0.3V
- VDS₂ = 0.3V > VGS₂ - VTH ≈ 0.25V ✓ (marginal but sufficient)

### 5. Testbench Approach

The testbench will:
1. Implement the current mirror with calculated component values
2. Sweep output voltage from 0 to 3.3V
3. Measure output current vs. voltage characteristic
4. Verify Iout = 100μA ± 10% for Vout > 0.3V
5. Check operating points and saturation conditions
