Looking at this challenging two-stage OTA design, I need to balance multiple competing requirements: high gain (≥60dB), high GBW (≥20MHz), good phase margin (≥60°), and adequate slew rate (≥5V/μs), all within a 100μA current budget.

## Design Approach and Topology Choice

I'll implement a classic two-stage Miller-compensated OTA:
- **Stage 1**: Differential pair with active (current mirror) load for high gain
- **Stage 2**: Common-source amplifier for additional gain and output drive capability  
- **Compensation**: Miller capacitor with nulling resistor for stability
- **Biasing**: Current mirror network for stable bias distribution

## Key Design Equations and Calculations

### Current Budget Allocation
Total current = 100μA:
- First stage tail current: 40μA (20μA per branch)
- Second stage current: 60μA (for output drive capability)

### Transistor Parameters from Models
From the GF180nm models:
- NMOS: Vth ≈ 0.7V, μn·Cox ≈ 100 μA/V² (estimated from u0 and tox)
- PMOS: Vth ≈ -0.83V, μp·Cox ≈ 40 μA/V² 

### First Stage Design
For GBW = 20MHz with compensation capacitor Cc ≈ 2pF:
- Required gm1 = 2π × GBW × Cc = 2π × 20×10⁶ × 2×10⁻¹² ≈ 250 μS
- With ID1,2 = 20μA each:
- (W/L)₁,₂ = gm1²/(2·μn·Cox·ID) ≈ 16

Input transistors M1,M2: W=8μm, L=0.5μm (using longer L for better matching)
Load transistors M3,M4: W=4μm, L=0.5μm (current mirror load)

### Second Stage Design
For adequate gain and slew rate:
- Output PMOS M6: W=24μm, L=0.4μm 
- Output NMOS M7: W=10μm, L=0.4μm
- Target Av2 ≈ 30-40 for overall gain >60dB

### Compensation Network
- Miller capacitor Cc = 2pF
- Nulling resistor Rc = 10kΩ (places zero beyond unity gain frequency)

### Biasing Network
Current mirrors scaled appropriately to generate required bias currents from a 10μA reference.

## Design Verification Approach

The testbench performs three key analyses:

1. **DC Operating Point**: Verifies all transistors are in saturation
2. **AC Analysis**: Measures gain (>60dB), GBW (>20MHz), and phase margin (>60°)
3. **Transient Analysis**: Verifies slew rate (>5V/μs) with differential step input

The design uses systematic current distribution (40/60 split), careful device sizing for transconductance requirements, and Miller compensation with nulling resistor to achieve the challenging combination of high gain, wide bandwidth, and stability with the large 20pF load capacitance. The bias network ensures stable operation across process variations.
